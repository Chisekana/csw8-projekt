# Step 1 - Overview

Restaurant Menu Management System - help with managing a database containing a restaurantâ€™s menu items (i.e. the food and beverage items that would appears on their printed menu, or a display menu on a computer monitor, for example.)

File 1 - functions.py file
Contains all the relevant Functions

File 2 - main.py
Contains the Main program

File 3 - tests.py
Contains the test code. Assert staments collected to help verify that implementation of each function is correct.
Test file is run separately since running the main program will not automatically execute the assert statements. Each function that returns values will need to have the corresponding assert statements to check its correctness. We'll have at least three assert statements for each function.
